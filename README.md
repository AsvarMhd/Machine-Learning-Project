# Mobile Phone Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of mobile phones based on various features such as brand, model, specifications, and other related factors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a mobile phone based on its features using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Brand
- Model
- Battery Capacity
- RAM Size
- Storage Size
- Screen Size
- Camera Quality
- Processor Type
- and other relevant attributes

## Technologies Used
- Python: For programming and building machine learning models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- Google Colab: As the environment for writing and executing code interactively.

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression : Used to predict continuous values (e.g., mobile price) by finding the best-fit line
between features and the target variable.

## Dataset Used
- Dataset : Used a third party publicly available dataset with mobile phone features.
- Features : Included technical specifications like RAM, storage, battery, processor, etc.
- Size of Dataset : 1370 Rows with 18 Columns

## Challenges
- The data may contain inconsistencies or missing features, making it difficult for the model to
learn effectively.
- A better dataset or more advanced preprocessing would be needed to reduce the error rate.
